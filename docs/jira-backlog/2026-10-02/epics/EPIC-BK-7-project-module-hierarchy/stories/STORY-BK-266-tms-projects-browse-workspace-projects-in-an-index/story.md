## Overview

## User story

As a QA Lead (Mateo), I want the active Workspace's Projects listed as the first thing I see after signing in, so that I can go straight to the Project I need instead of being asked to create a new one.

## Context

Signing in currently lands a member on `/projects`, and that route is not an index. It renders the create-project form centred on the screen, and the Projects that already exist are demoted to a narrow side card that only appears once the Workspace has at least one Project. The de-facto landing screen therefore asks for something new before showing what is already there — an onboarding step replayed on every visit.

For a QA Lead who lives in three or four Projects at once, that is the wrong first question. The first screen should answer "what exists and where do I go", and creating a Project should be a deliberate act with its own address, not the default state of the landing screen.

> ***INFO:*** This story changes what `/projects` renders and adds `/projects/new`. It does not touch where `/` sends a signed-in member ([https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-255#icft=BK-255](https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-255#icft=BK-255) owns that) and it does not build the Home dashboard (epic [https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-254#icft=BK-254](https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-254#icft=BK-254) owns that).
