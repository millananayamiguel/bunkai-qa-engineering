# BK-203 — Acceptance Criteria

> Jira field: `customfield_10110` · [View in Jira](https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-203)

```
Scenario: Should list all selected tests and update the count after a multi-select add
  Given the Open plan "Release 2.4 regression" has 0 tests
  And the project's test library contains "Checkout with saved card" and 11 other matching tests
  When Elena (member role) opens the add-tests picker, searches "checkout", selects "Checkout with saved card" plus 11 more tests, and confirms
  Then the plan's test table lists all 12 tests with name, tags, and added-by
  And the plan header count reads 12
  And the plans list view also reflects a count of 12 for this plan
```

```
Scenario: Should add a single test to an empty plan
  Given the Open plan "Smoke pass" has 0 tests
  When Elena selects exactly 1 test "Login with valid credentials" and confirms
  Then the plan lists 1 test
  And the plan header count reads 1
  And the empty state no longer renders
```

```
Scenario: Should allow the same test to be a member of two different plans independently
  Given "Login with valid credentials" already belongs to plan "Smoke pass"
  When Elena adds it to plan "Release 2.4 regression"
  Then the test is a member of both plans
  And each plan's own count reflects its own membership independently
```

```
Scenario: Should leave a shared test in the other plan after removal from one
  Given "Login with valid credentials" is a member of both "Smoke pass" and "Release 2.4 regression"
  When Elena removes it from "Release 2.4 regression"
  Then it no longer appears in "Release 2.4 regression" and its count decreases by 1
  And it remains a member of "Smoke pass" with its count unchanged
```

```
Scenario: Should mark an already-included test in the picker and prevent re-selection
  Given "Checkout with saved card" is already in plan "Release 2.4 regression"
  When Elena opens the add-tests picker for that plan and searches for it
  Then the test is shown with an "already in plan" marker
  And it cannot be selected or checked
  And if attempted via a direct API call with that test id anyway, the request is rejected without creating a duplicate row
  And the plan's test count is unchanged
```

```
Scenario: Should reject a duplicate add via direct API call bypassing the picker's UI marker
  # NEEDS PO/DEV CONFIRMATION: exact status code + error shape inferred, not stated in the Story -- Dev answered 2026-08-16: HTTP 409, ApiError('conflict', 'This test is already in the plan.'), SQLSTATE 23505 unique_violation
  Given "Checkout with saved card" is already in plan "Release 2.4 regression"
  When a direct API call attempts to add the same plan and test pair again
  Then the request is rejected with a uniqueness-violation error
  And no new row is created
  And the plan's test count is unchanged
```

```
Scenario: Should remove a test from the plan and decrement the count without altering the test itself
  Given plan "Release 2.4 regression" contains "Legacy export"
  When Elena removes "Legacy export" from the plan
  Then the plan no longer lists it
  And the count decreases by exactly 1
  And "Legacy export" still exists unchanged (same id, name, tags, content) in the project's test library
```

```
Scenario: Should return to the empty state when the last test is removed
  # NEEDS PO/DEV CONFIRMATION: exact empty-state trigger inferred from a business-rules.md design-intent line, not from an AC
  Given plan "Smoke pass" contains exactly 1 test
  When Elena removes that test
  Then the plan's table renders its empty state
  And the count reads 0 with no residual drift
```

```
Scenario: Should hide add and remove controls for a viewer while still showing member tests
  Given Lucia has the viewer role in the workspace
  When she opens the plan "Release 2.4 regression"
  Then she can see the member tests table
  And the "Add tests" button and each row's Remove action are not rendered
```

```
Scenario: Should reject a viewer's direct API attempt to add or remove a membership row
  # NEEDS PO/DEV CONFIRMATION: inferred from this repo's established defense-in-depth RBAC pattern, not stated in AC5 itself
  Given Lucia (viewer) has a valid session
  When she issues a direct API call to add or remove a test from a plan in her workspace
  Then the request is rejected server-side
  And the rejection is independent of the UI's absent affordance
```

```
Scenario: Should reject a membership add or remove attempted against a Closed plan
  # NEEDS PO/DEV CONFIRMATION: PO answered 2026-08-16 -- hide controls entirely in the UI, server-side rejection enforced as backstop. Error code corrected 2026-08-23: 45603 test*plan*not_open (real shipped code), replacing the 2026-08-16 placeholder guess of 45510
  Given plan "Release 2.4 regression" is Closed
  When a member-role user attempts to add or remove a test, via UI if the control renders and via direct API regardless
  Then the mutation is rejected server-side
  And no membership row is created or deleted
  And the UI clearly communicates the plan is Closed if the control is reachable at all
```

```
Scenario: Should reject a Test from a different project when added to a plan
  # NEEDS PO/DEV CONFIRMATION: PO answered 2026-08-16 -- both layers enforced (picker scoping for UX, mandatory server-side validation on every write)
  Given plan "Release 2.4 regression" belongs to Project A
  And a Test "Foo" exists only in Project B
  When a direct API call attempts to add Test "Foo" to the plan
  Then the request is rejected server-side regardless of what the picker's search-result scoping shows
```

```
Scenario: Should not create a duplicate membership row on a rapid double-submit of the same add-tests selection
  # NEEDS PO/DEV CONFIRMATION: Dev answered 2026-08-16 -- Idempotency-Key header middleware plus a unique(plan*id, test*id) DB constraint as a second backstop
  Given Elena has selected 3 tests in the picker and clicks confirm twice in rapid succession
  When both requests reach the server
  Then exactly 3 membership rows exist afterward, not 6
```

```
Scenario: Should show a distinct empty-results state when the add-tests picker search matches nothing
  # NEEDS PO/DEV CONFIRMATION: Dev answered 2026-08-16 -- copy is "No tests match." in italic, muted style
  Given the add-tests picker is open for a plan
  When Elena searches a term matching no Tests in the project's library
  Then an explicit "no results" state renders
  And it is distinct from a loading state
```
