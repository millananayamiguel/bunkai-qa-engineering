# TEST: BK-337: TC08: should read 10 of 10 at the hard cap with no truncation

**Jira Key:** [BK-526](https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-526)
**Status:** DEPRECATED
**Components:** Bunkai Bugs

---

## Test Description

> ***WARNING:**** ****DEPRECATED by ****`/test-documentation`**** Stage 4 on 2026-09-01.**** Superseded by ****BK-524***. Do not execute this Test and do not automate it.

## Why it was deprecated

It held the hard cap of the evidence range. Same behaviour as the zero and mid-range cases, so it became an Examples row rather than its own artifact.

A Test is identified by its precondition and its action. This Test shared both with BK-524, so keeping them apart would store one behaviour as several regression artifacts, each needing its own fixture setup and its own maintenance for no additional coverage.

## What was preserved

Nothing was lost. Every assertion this Test carried now lives inside BK-524, which was rewritten to hold them as a grouped assertion block.

This issue is deprecated rather than deleted so the sprint execution history on Test Execution ***BK-518*** stays intact and auditable: it really did run, and it really did pass, on 2026-08-19.
