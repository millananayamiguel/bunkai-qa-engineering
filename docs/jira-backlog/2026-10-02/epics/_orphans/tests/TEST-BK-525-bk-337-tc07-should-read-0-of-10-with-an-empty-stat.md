# TEST: BK-337: TC07: should read 0 of 10 with an empty state when no evidence was attached

**Jira Key:** [BK-525](https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-525)
**Status:** DEPRECATED
**Components:** Bunkai Bugs

## Test Description

> ***WARNING:**** ****DEPRECATED by ****`/test-documentation`**** Stage 4 on 2026-09-01.**** Superseded by ****BK-524***. Do not execute this Test and do not automate it.

## Why it was deprecated

It held the lower boundary of the evidence cap. One behaviour across three boundary values of one variable belongs in one parameterized Test, not three.

A Test is identified by its precondition and its action. This Test shared both with BK-524, so keeping them apart would store one behaviour as several regression artifacts, each needing its own fixture setup and its own maintenance for no additional coverage.

## What was preserved

Nothing was lost. Every assertion this Test carried now lives inside BK-524, which was rewritten to hold them as a grouped assertion block.

This issue is deprecated rather than deleted so the sprint execution history on Test Execution ***BK-518*** stays intact and auditable: it really did run, and it really did pass, on 2026-08-19.
