# BK-508 — Business Rules

> Jira field: `customfield_10152` · [View in Jira](https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-508)

- Only a workspace ***Owner*** may request or download a workspace data export. Admin, Member and Viewer do not see the section at all — it is absent for them, not present-and-refused
- An export covers exactly ***one*** workspace: the one the requester currently has active. It never spans several workspaces, even when the Owner owns more than one
- The archive holds the workspace's own records only. It never contains another workspace's data
- The archive never contains a credential of any kind — no Personal Access Token secret, no magic-link token, no invite token
- The archive is a structured, machine-readable format, so the recipient can process it without Bunkai. That is what makes it usable as an answer to a data-portability request
- ***At most one export request per workspace is in flight at a time.*** A second request while one is preparing is refused with the reason, not silently queued and not silently replacing the first
- A ready archive is downloadable for a bounded window. Once that window lapses the link stops working, the section states that it has expired, and a fresh request produces a fresh archive
- Every export request and every download of a ready archive is recorded in the workspace Activity Stream — an export is itself an auditable event, and an Owner reaching for compliance evidence needs the export's own trail to exist
- An export never changes the workspace's data. It is a read of the workspace, and running one leaves every record exactly as it was

## Confirmed via Shift-Left PO/Dev answers (2026-08-24)

- The download window is ***7 days (168 hours)*** from the moment the archive becomes ready.
- The "at most one export in flight" rule is scoped ***per workspace***, not per Owner — an Owner with two workspaces may have two exports preparing at once, one per workspace.
- A Personal Access Token can ***never*** request or download a workspace export. This action is cookie-session (Owner) only, regardless of PAT scope.
