**Jira Key:** [BK-498](https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-498)
**Epic:** [BK-1](https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-1) (Tenancy & Identity)
**Type:** Story
**Status:** Ready For Release
**Priority:** Medium
**Story Points:** 8

## Overview

## User story

***As a*** Karim, the autonomous AI test agent that authenticates to Bunkai with a Personal Access Token
***I want to*** have my token's capability scope enforced on every authoring-domain route (modules, user stories, acceptance criteria, environments, milestones, imports)
***So that*** a token minted for read-only or unrelated work can never create, change or delete authoring content, whether by mistake or because the token leaked

## Definition of done

- All 22 authoring-domain handlers require a capability: writes require `atc:write`, reads require `atc:read`.
- A properly-scoped token succeeds; an under-scoped token is rejected with 403 before any change happens.
- No database migration.

## Provenance

This Story is one of three successors split from ***BK-262*** ("PAT | Enforce capability scopes on every non-ATC route"), which is `ABORTED` (split, not abandoned). It depends on "PAT | Require every API route to declare its capability posture" (the Foundation slice), whose compile-time union this Story's routes must already satisfy. The split, its rationale, and the acceptance-criteria allocation are decided in the AI Product Owner and AI Tech Lead rulings posted on [https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-262#icft=BK-262](https://jira.upexgalaxy.com/browse/BK-262#icft=BK-262) on 2026-08-17, under CLAUDE.md Critical Rule #18. This Story carries BK-262's `shift-left-2026-08-14` / `shift-left-reviewed` labels forward as provenance of its refinement source.
